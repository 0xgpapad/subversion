See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can

Status of 1.14.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1876020
   Fix Proc.new warnings in Ruby bindings with Ruby >= 2.7
   Justification:
     Tests should pass cleanly against latest upstream
   Votes:
     +1: jamessan, stsp

 * r1876016, r1876050
   Explain SWIG is needed for building Python 2 bindings.
   Justification:
     Target of Python bindings SWIG-generated source code in the distribution
     tarballs will switch to Python 3 in 1.14.0, however we still allow to
     build bindings for Python 2
   Votes:
     +1: futatuki, hartmannathan

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1875680
   Construct KAboutData using QString rather than QStringLiteral
   Justification:
     Fixes a crash seen when using git-svn with kwallet
   Votes:
     +1: jamessan, stsp, cmpilato

 * r1875726
   Error out if generating SWIG-related files fails in autogen.sh --release
   Justification:
     release.py didn't catch this error when 1.14.0-rc1 release was created
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, hartmannathan, jamessan

 * r1875742, r1875762
   Fix autogen.sh SWIG python bindings generation in --release mode.
   Justification:
     We can no longer create usable release artifacts without this fix.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, jamessan, cmpilato

 * r1875918
   rep-cache.db insert optimization
   Justification:
     Small performance optimization.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, cmpilato, jamessan

 * r1875921, r1875925, r1875973, r1876010
   Introduce 'svnadmin build-repcache' command.
   Justification:
     Low-risk and useful feature addition. It would be nice to get this
     merged in time for 1.14.0. Else this would have to wait until 1.15.0.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, cmpilato, jamessan
     +0: danielsh (without r1875973, r1876010)
