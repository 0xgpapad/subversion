Candidate changes:
==================

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1875742, r1875762
   Fix autogen.sh SWIG python bindings generation in --release mode.
   Justification:
     We can no longer create usable release artifacts without this fix.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, jamessan, cmpilato

 * r1875918
   rep-cache.db insert optimization
   Justification:
     Small performance optimization.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, cmpilato, jamessan

 * r1875921, r1875925, r1875973, r1876010
   Introduce 'svnadmin build-repcache' command.
   Justification:
     Low-risk and useful feature addition. It would be nice to get this
     merged in time for 1.14.0. Else this would have to wait until 1.15.0.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, cmpilato, jamessan
     +0: danielsh (without r1875973, r1876010)

 * r1876016, r1876050
   Explain SWIG is needed for building Python 2 bindings.
   Justification:
     Target of Python bindings SWIG-generated source code in the distribution
     tarballs will switch to Python 3 in 1.14.0, however we still allow to
     build bindings for Python 2

 * r1876054
   Fix undefined behavior when constructing ID for txn_node_cache in fsfs.
   Justification:
     Fixes potential crash in apr_pstrcat(). Pretty obvious fix.
   Votes:
    +1: stsp, jamessan, hartmannathan

 * r1876068
   Add libsvn_shelf.h and libsvn_shelf2.h to msvc-export, needed for the
