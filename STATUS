Status of 1.11.2:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1852436
   Make 'svn update' not record a tree conflict when deleting an unmodified
   directory which happens to contain unversioned items.
   Justification:
     Unnecessary tree conflict due to e.g. build artifacts on disk.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================
