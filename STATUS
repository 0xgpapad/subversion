Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1866425
   mod_dav_svn: Set Last-Modified response header for 'external' GET requests.
   Justification:
     The Last-Modified header was removed in r1724790 for performance reasons.
     However, for external requests the Last-Modified header is needed for
     certain use cases. Bringing it back only for external requests fixes
     these, while keeping the performance gain for checkout / update.
