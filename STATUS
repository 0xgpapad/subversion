Status of 1.11.2:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1851903
   Fix missing unlock of working copy in a resolver error case.
   Justification:
     Could force users to run 'svn cleanup' unnecessarily.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1851920
   Remove a useless common ancestor search from the conflict resolver.
   Justification:
     Current behaviour is inefficient and could lead to dubious conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1852436
   Make 'svn update' not record a tree conflict when deleting an unmodified
   directory which happens to contain unversioned items.
   Justification:
     Unnecessary tree conflict due to e.g. build artifacts on disk.

     IRC discussion:

 * r1853450
   Enable 'incoming_move_file_merge' option only if local change is file edit.
   Justification:
     Conflict resolver misbehaves when it runs into move vs move conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1855419
   Fix conflict resolver bug where local and incoming edits got swapped.
   Justification:
     Bug breaks text conflict resolution.

   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.11.x-r1855419
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1856397
   Allow generating Visual Studio 2019 projects
