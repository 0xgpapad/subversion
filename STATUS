Status of 1.14.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1876410
   Fix the .editorconfig stanza for Makefile's.
   Justification:
     Make $EDITOR do the right thing on any backport branches we may create
     off this stabilization branch.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, stsp

 * r1877960
   * INSTALL (I.C.12): Add Note that non-release mode is required for building
     SWIG Python 2 bindings.
   Justification:
     We've not entirely dropped Python 2 bindings support on 1.14.x yet
   Votes:
     +1: futatuki, stsp

 * r1876906
   Make gen-make.py --debug work with Python 3
   Justification:
     We should also be able to build in Debug configuration with Python 3
     on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: jcorvel, stsp

 * r1876662
   Avoid check for SWIG version for Python bindings when --witout-swig is
   passed.
   Justification:
     SWIG python bindings should be able to be built without SWIG when we use
     the release tarball
   Votes:
     +1: futatuki, stsp

 * r1878413
   autogen.sh: Remove per SWIG bindings checked files on release mode.
   Justification:
     The release tarballs should not contain .swig_*_checked files
   Votes:
     +1: futatuki

 * r1878909, r1878918, r1878950
   Fix a number of thinkos in human-readable file size formatting.
   Justification:
     Fixes wrong output and an assertion failure in debug mode.
   Votes:
     +1: brane

 * r1879198
   Fix an invalid quoting in working copy upgrade system that only works
   because SQLite automatically fixed this. More recent SQLite functions
   will signal an error when deprecated features are disabled.
   Note:
     This filechange by itself doesn't trigger a change that make will
     handle. So make sure you recompile the sql queries for testing.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1879198
   Fix invalid escape sequence in working copy queries which causes upgrades
   from Subversion 1.7 working copies to fail with recent SQLite versions (>=
   3.29.0).
   Justification:
     Causes user-visible errors.

     +1: danielsh
