This branch is aimed at fixing issue #4869 [1] and adding regression tests for
the issue.

The problem is that while 'svn info' on a file with tree conflicts shows the
correct left and right sides of conflict, 'svn info --xml' shows the correct
left side but incorrect right side; specifically, it repeats the same
information for left and right sides.

The bug was reported in the users@ mail thread "svn info tree conflicts bug
using svn 1.10.6" archived at [2] and [3]. It affects all versions from
1.10.0 through trunk HEAD at the time of this branch. The bug was introduced
due to a simple copy-paste mistake in r1687415 because no regression test
existed to catch it. The feature works correctly in 1.9.x.

The reporter provided the following reproduction script:

[[[

#!/bin/bash
set -eu
svn --version | head -1
TEST_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
svnadmin create $TEST_DIR/test-repos
REPOS_URL="file://$TEST_DIR/test-repos"
svn mkdir -q -m "" $REPOS_URL/trunk
svn copy -q -m "" $REPOS_URL/trunk@1 $REPOS_URL/branch1
svn copy -q -m "" $REPOS_URL/trunk@1 $REPOS_URL/branch2
svn checkout -q $REPOS_URL/branch1 $TEST_DIR/wc
cd $TEST_DIR/wc
echo "Test 1" > file
svn add -q file
svn commit -q -m ""
svn switch -q $REPOS_URL/branch2
echo "Test 2" > file
svn add -q file
svn commit -q -m ""
svn update -q
svn merge --non-interactive $REPOS_URL/branch1
echo === svn info file
svn info file
echo === svn info --xml file
svn info --xml file
cd $OLDPWD
rm -rf $TEST_DIR

]]]
